# 💫 About Me

🔭 I’m currently working on building a deep and strategic understanding of Artificial Intelligence, including its ethics, alignment, and long-term impact.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on research-driven AI projects, particularly those involving language models, interpretability, or quantum-AI intersections.

🤝 I’m open to mentorship, opportunities to contribute to meaningful open-source projects, and expanding my network in the AI research community.

🌱 I’m currently learning advanced machine learning concepts, Python for AI research, and the foundations of quantum computing and blockchain technologies.

💬 Ask me about AI ethics, Bitcoin fundamentals, or how I design a calm, focused workflow rooted in Japanese philosophy.

⚡ Fun fact: I approach life and learning through a crafted persona called **"Kuroya"** — a quiet strategist inspired by anime, philosophy, and complex characters like Levi Ackerman and Walter White.
