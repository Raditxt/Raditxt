# ⚔️ About Me — Raditya

🔭 I’m currently focused on building **strong fundamentals in Data Analysis and Machine Learning**, with an emphasis on **clean pipelines, statistical reasoning, and practical implementation in Python**.

🧠 My work centers on:
- Data cleaning & exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Classical Machine Learning models
- Model evaluation & interpretation
- Writing clear, reproducible, and well-documented code

I believe **solid fundamentals compound faster than chasing trends**.

🤝 I’m open to collaborating on **data analysis and machine learning projects**, especially those involving real-world datasets and end-to-end workflows.

🚀 My current goal is to become **job-ready in Data / ML** by consistently shipping small but well-structured projects, documented publicly as part of a disciplined learning system.

🌱 Currently learning:  
`Python` • `NumPy` • `Pandas` • `Matplotlib` • `Statistics` • `Machine Learning (scikit-learn)` • `Git/Linux`

💬 Ask me about:  
Data analysis workflows • ML fundamentals • Feature engineering • Model evaluation • Learning systems & consistency

🛡️ Principle:  
`Build fundamentals.` `Ship projects.` `No hype.`
